# bitcoind-rasp-zero
Bitcoind node build from source for Raspberry Pi Zero W

Nothing special, just a bash script that installs and runs bitcoind node on a Raspberry Pi W. 

This is a minimal install meaning no wallet, just a node for the network. :)

What you need:

1. 16GB sdcard (faster the better)
2. NOOBS installed - https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/noobs.md
3. Wireless networking setup to access the internet

Download the shell script, chmod +x to run, and launch
